## 👩‍🏫 Faculty Concerns About GitHub Copilot in the Classroom

### 🛑 “Aren’t students just using Copilot to cheat?”
**Response:**  
That’s a valid concern—and one I share. Like calculators or spellcheckers, AI tools can be misused. The key is how we frame and scaffold their use. I position Copilot as a “thinking partner,” not a shortcut. Assignments include reflection prompts where students explain what Copilot suggested, why they accepted or changed it, and how it influenced their thinking.

---

### 📉 “How do you know if students actually understand the code they submit?”
**Response:**  
Copilot makes this tricky—but it also gives us a new opportunity. I require students to comment on their Copilot-assisted code and complete short reflections. Peer review and one-on-one check-ins also help gauge understanding.

---

### ❌ “Doesn’t Copilot give wrong or inefficient code sometimes?”
**Response:**  
Absolutely—and that’s actually a strength when used correctly. When Copilot gives something flawed or inefficient, we stop and ask: “Why doesn’t this work?” or “How could this be improved?” Students learn critical thinking and debugging in context.

---

### 🌐 “What about equity? Not all students have fast internet or powerful laptops to run Copilot.”
**Response:**  
Access is a real concern. I address it in a few ways:  
- Provide demo videos  
- Focus on problem-solving first  
- Use shared or in-class simulations  

---

### 🧑‍💻 “I teach a language Copilot doesn’t handle well—so how is this relevant to me?”
**Response:**  
Copilot is strongest in popular languages, but the value lies in developing **AI literacy**: evaluating output, understanding limitations, and ethical use—skills applicable across many disciplines.

---

### 🤖 “Aren’t we training students to rely on AI instead of learning to code?”
**Response:**  
That’s why I emphasize intentional use. I tell students, “You can use Copilot, but you still have to drive.” If they can revise flawed suggestions and explain their logic, they’re learning—not outsourcing.

---

### 🤷‍♀️ “What if I’m not comfortable using Copilot myself—how can I teach it?”
**Response:**  
You don’t need to be an expert to start. Explore it alongside your students. Use small demos, reflection, and group discussions. Being transparent about your learning curve creates a more open learning environment.

## 🧑‍🏫 Getting Started with GitHub Copilot: Common Questions from New Faculty Users

### 🧩 “How do I install GitHub Copilot in my code editor?”
**Answer:**  
Install it from the Extensions view in **Visual Studio Code**. You’ll need to sign into GitHub. Verified faculty can get free access through the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

---

### ⚙️ “What does Copilot actually do while I’m coding?”
**Answer:**  
It suggests code as you type. For example, typing a comment like `// calculate tax` might trigger Copilot to offer a full function.

---

### 🌍 “Can I use Copilot in languages other than JavaScript or Python?”
**Answer:**  
Yes—Copilot supports many languages including Java, C++, HTML/CSS, and SQL. Accuracy is strongest in widely used, well-documented languages.

---

### 📚 “Is there a learning curve to using Copilot?”
**Answer:**  
A small one. The key is being descriptive with comments and critically reviewing suggestions. Most users get comfortable within a few sessions.

---

### ✅ “How do I know when to trust Copilot’s suggestions?”
**Answer:**  
If you can’t explain the suggestion, don’t accept it yet. Encourage testing and discussion, just like reviewing peer advice.

---

### ✍️ “Can I use Copilot to help write documentation or comments?”
**Answer:**  
Yes—Copilot often generates helpful docstrings or comment blocks. Always review for accuracy and clarity.

---

### ⚠️ “What if I accidentally accept bad code?”
**Answer:**  
That’s okay—it’s part of the learning process. Use Git to undo changes, and treat mistakes as learning opportunities.

---

### 🎛️ “Can I control when Copilot is active?”
**Answer:**  
Yes—Copilot can be toggled on/off in VS Code settings. You can disable it by file type or context if needed.

---

### 🧪 “How can I practice using Copilot before showing it to my students?”
**Answer:**  
Use a sandbox project. Try common coding prompts and test how Copilot responds. It’s a great way to anticipate student questions.

---

### 🔌 “Does Copilot work offline?”
**Answer:**  
No. Copilot requires an internet connection to generate suggestions.
