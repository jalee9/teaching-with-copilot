## 💻 AI Coding Tools Policy (e.g., GitHub Copilot)

In this course, students are permitted to use AI-assisted coding tools such as **GitHub Copilot** under the following conditions:

- ✅ **Review and Revise**  
  You must review, understand, and revise any code suggestions before using them in assignments.

- ✅ **Academic Integrity**  
  You are responsible for ensuring that all submitted work aligns with course outcomes and the college’s academic integrity policy.

- ✅ **Annotate Copilot Use**  
  All AI-generated code must be clearly annotated in your comments.  
  Example: `// Suggested by GitHub Copilot and modified`

- ⚠️ **Understand Your Code**  
  Over-reliance on Copilot without demonstrating understanding may negatively impact your grade and your ability to succeed in future coursework.

📣 **Remember:**  
Copilot can be a helpful learning partner, but it does not replace your role as the coder. Use it to **enhance** your thinking, not **bypass** it.
