### ðŸ”Ž Why This Project Was Created

The rise of AI in education prompted a need for intentional, student-centered teaching strategies. GitHub Copilot is powerful, but it requires thoughtful scaffolding, reflection, and structure to become a tool for learningâ€”not a shortcut.

### ðŸ‘¥ Who Itâ€™s For

- Faculty teaching coding, web development, IT, or computer science
- Instructors exploring AI integration in practical, ethical ways
- Educators looking for low-barrier, remixable classroom-ready materials

---

### ðŸ’» How Itâ€™s Used in the Classroom

These resources reflect real practices from my own courses:
- Live Copilot demos with student Q&A
- Labs with scaffolded Copilot prompts and checkpoints
- Structured pair programming with peer feedback
- Reflections and ethics discussions built into assignments

### ðŸŽ¯ Pedagogical Goals

- Boost student confidence, especially for beginners or adult learners
- Promote active learning and metacognitive reflection
- Encourage ethical conversations about AI tools
- Build digital literacy and job-ready tech fluency

### ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

This project is built on the belief that AI tools like Copilot should **amplify** teaching, not replace it. Used intentionally, Copilot can support creativity, collaboration, and curiosity.

Educators are invited to adapt, remix, and share. Together, we can shape a future where AI and education coexist with purpose and integrity.
